# AI Quest System for Metaverse

This document explains how to use the AI Quest System in the metaverse to train machine learning models through gamified quests.

## Overview

The AI Quest System allows both metaverse owners and users to:

1. Create quests that gather training data for AI models
2. Participate in quests to help train AI models
3. Deploy trained models in the metaverse
4. Create custom AI behaviors through a gamified experience

The system is designed to make AI training accessible and enjoyable, turning what would normally be a technical process into interactive gameplay.

## Quest Types

The system currently supports these quest types:

### NPC Behavior Training

These quests help train AI models that control NPC behavior, dialogue, and interactions. Users rate NPC responses to different scenarios and provide better alternatives.

Example tasks:

- Rate how natural an NPC's response was
- Suggest better dialogue for a given situation
- Rank multiple responses from best to worst
- Identify emotions in NPC responses

### Object Recognition

These quests gather training data to improve the AI's ability to recognize and classify objects in the metaverse.

Example tasks:

- Identify and label objects in a scene
- Classify objects into categories
- Describe the features of objects
- Match similar objects

### Custom Models

Advanced users can create custom quests for specialized AI models. This system provides the framework for gathering training data through quests, which can then be used with custom ML models.

## Participating in Quests

To participate in a quest:

1. Open the Quest UI panel in your metaverse client
2. Browse available quests and select one
3. Complete the steps as instructed
4. Earn rewards upon completion

Each quest submission provides valuable training data that improves the metaverse AI systems.

## Creating Quests (For Owners and Approved Users)

To create a new quest:

1. Open the Quest UI panel
2. Click "Create New Quest"
3. Fill in the quest details:
   - Name and description
   - Quest type
   - Difficulty level
   - Rewards for completion
4. Add steps:
   - Each step should gather specific data
   - Choose from text input, multiple choice, or rating task types
   - Provide clear instructions for users
5. Publish the quest

The system will automatically use the collected data to train the associated AI model once enough responses have been gathered.

## Technical Implementation

The AI Quest System consists of:

1. **ML Quest System Backend**: Manages quest creation, progress tracking, and model training
2. **ML Models**: Handles the actual machine learning operations
3. **Quest UI**: Frontend interface for interacting with quests
4. **API Endpoints**: For programmatic interaction with the quest system

## Training Process

When users complete quests, their responses are collected as training data. Once enough data is gathered (typically 10+ responses per model), the system will:

1. Process and format the training data
2. Train or update the ML model
3. Save the model weights and metadata
4. Make the improved model available in the metaverse

## Data Storage

Quest training data and model information are stored in:

- `./data/ml_models/`: Contains model definitions and weights
- `./data/training_data/`: Contains training data collected from quests

## API Reference

The following REST API endpoints are available:

- `GET /api/quests`: List available quests
- `GET /api/quest/{quest_id}`: Get quest details
- `POST /api/quest/{quest_id}/start`: Start a quest
- `POST /api/quest/{quest_id}/submit`: Submit a quest step response
- `POST /api/quest/create`: Create a new quest
- `GET /api/ml/models`: List available ML models
- `GET /api/ml/model/{model_id}`: Get model details
- `POST /api/ml/model/{model_id}/predict`: Make a prediction using a trained model
- `POST /api/ml/model/{model_id}/train`: Manually trigger model training

WebSocket events are also available for real-time interaction.

## Example Use Cases

1. **Virtual Tour Guide**: Train an AI to provide accurate information about locations in the metaverse
2. **Character Personality Development**: Create NPCs with distinct personalities and responses
3. **Environmental Recognition**: Train AI to recognize environmental conditions and respond appropriately
4. **Content Moderation**: Help train AI to identify inappropriate content

## Future Developments

Planned enhancements for the AI Quest System:

1. **Advanced Model Types**: Support for image generation, audio processing, and more
2. **Quest Chaining**: Create complex quest sequences that build sophisticated models
3. **Community Voting**: Allow users to vote on the best AI models
4. **AI Competitions**: Host competitions where users create the best AI for specific tasks
5. **Real-world Integration**: Connect metaverse AI training with real-world applications
